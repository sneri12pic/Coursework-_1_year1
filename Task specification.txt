Produce a command line application, called csource,
that reads in a .c file containing C source code, and outputs the following
to the console:

1. The total number of lines in the .c file (including any blank lines).
2. The number of characters in the .c file, excluding newlines, spaces and tabs.
3. The number of comments in the file. You only need to consider comments that begin with //, and you can assume that a space separates
	the // from the first character of the comment.
4. The number of variables declared in the input .c file.

This includes local variables declared in functions, and function parameters. Your application only needs to consider variables of type int, double, and
char, and their corresponding array and pointer types. For simplicity you may assume that every variable name will be followed by white space, e.g. int x = 5 ;
Finally, your application should produce an output file listing each variable declared in the .c file, and a count of the number of times that variable 1 
is referenced in the code after the line on which it is declared.
